# ms-elk
This is a Multi-scale and FP-LAPW code for simulation of interactions between between ultrafast intense laser pulses and condensed medium.

All the install, compile, and execute are the same as the orginal elk code, an example for the Multi-scale simulation is provided 
in the ms-elk/examples/ms/ directory. 

Note the new input parameter "multi-scale".
