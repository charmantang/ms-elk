# ms-elk
This is a Multi-scale and FP-LAPW code for simulations of interactions between between ultrafast intense laser pulses and condensed medium based on local  modification of elk-6.8.4.

All the install, compile, and execute are the same as the orginal elk code.

An example for the Multi-scale simulation is provided in the ms-elk/examples/ms/ directory. 

Note the new input parameter "multi-scale".
